        1. Origins to a Bloody Pagan Festival
      </h2>
      <p>
        Some trace Valentine’s Day origins to a Christian effort to replace a
        pagan fertility festival that has been dated as far back as the 6th
        century B.C. During the festival of Lupercalia, Roman priests would
        sacrifice goats and dogs and use their blood-soaked hides to slap women
        on the streets, as a fertility blessing. According to legend, women
        would later put their names in an urn and be selected to be paired with
        a man for a year.

        2. Letters Addressed to 'Juliet'
      </h2>
      <p>
        Every year, thousands of romantics send letters addressed to Verona,
        Italy to “Juliet,” the subject of the timeless romantic tragedy, “Romeo
        and Juliet.” The city marks the location of the Shakespearean tale, and
        the letters that reach the city are dutifully answered by a team of
        volunteers from the Juliet Club. Each year, on Valentine's Day, the club
        awards the "Cara Giulietta" ("Dear Juliet") prize to the author of the
        most touching love letter.

      <h2 id="Box of Chocolates">3. Box of Chocolates</h2>
      <p>
        The Valentine’s Day tradition of giving a box of candy was started in
        the 19th century by Richard Cadbury, a scion of a British chocolate
        manufacturing family. With a new technique recently established at the
        company to create more varieties of chocolate, Cadbury pounced on the
        opportunity to sell the chocolates as part of the beloved holiday.

        4. First Valentine Was Written From a Prison
      </h2>
      <p>
        History’s first valentine was written in perhaps one of the most
        unromantic places conceivable: a prison. Charles, Duke of Orleans wrote
        the love letter to his second wife at the age of 21 while captured at
        the Battle of Agincourt. As a prisoner for more than 20 years, he would
        never see his valentine’s reaction to the poem he penned to her in the
        early 15th century.

        5. ‘Vinegar Valentines’ Discouraged Suitors
      </h2>
      <p>
        During the Victoria Era, those who didn’t want the attention of certain
        suitors would anonymously send “vinegar valentines." These cards, also
        called penny dreadfuls, were the antithesis of customary valentines,
        comically insulting and rejecting unwanted admirers. They were later
        used to target suffragettes in the late 19th and early 20th century.

        6. ‘Wearing Your Heart on Your Sleeve’
      </h2>
      <p>
        The term “wearing your heart on your sleeve” may have origins in picking
        a valentine. Smithsonian reports that during the Middle Ages, men would
        draw the names of women who they would be coupled with for the upcoming
        year while attending a Roman festival honoring Juno. After choosing, the
        men wore the names on their sleeves to show their bond during the
        festivities.

        7. ‘Sweethearts’ Candies Started Out as Lozenges
      </h2>
      <p>
        The iconic chalky heart-shaped candies that have been passed out
        lovingly every Valentine’s Day started out as lozenges. According to the
        Food Business News, pharmacist and inventor Oliver Chase created a
        machine that would quickly create the lozenges before switching to using
        the machine to create candy—later known as Necco Wafers. <br />
        <br />
        Chase’s brother came up with the idea to print messages on the candy in
        1866, and the candies got their heart shape in 1901, appealing
        specifically to Valentine’s Day sweethearts.

      <h2 id="Cupid Began as a Greek God">8. Cupid Began as a Greek God</h2>
      <p>
        The chubby baby with wings and a bow and arrow that we call Cupid has
        been associated with Valentine’s Day for centuries. However, before he
        was renamed Cupid, he was known to the ancient Greeks as Eros, the god
        of love. Eros, the son of Greek goddess Aphrodite, would use two sets of
        arrows—one for love and another for hate—to play with the emotions of
        his targets. It wasn’t until stories of his mischief were told by Romans
        that he adopted the childlike appearance that we recognize today

      <h2 id="How 'X' Came to Mean 'Kiss'">10. How ‘X’ Came to Mean ‘Kiss’</h2>
      <p>
        The idea of using a kiss to sign off on valentines also has a long
        history, according to the Washington Post. The use of “X” came to
        represent Christianity, or the cross, in the Middle Ages. During the
        same time, the symbol was used to sign off on documents. After marking
        with an X, the writer would often kiss the mark as a sign of their oath.
        As the gesture grew among kings and commoners to certify books, letters
        and paperwork, these records were described as having been “sealed with
        a kiss.”
